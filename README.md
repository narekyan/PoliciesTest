# Cuvva Mobile Tech Test

Hi, 
Here you can see implementation of the test.
I used storyboard, MVVM architecture, also I have added some Unit tests.


* Roughly how long you took  -  I spent 6 hours (maybe little bit more)
* Any special instructions on how to build and run the app  -  just open in Xcode as usual
* A list of "Things I would include / do differently if I had more time"  -  I see some issues with UI, I could make it better,, and also Model part
* Rationale for using any 3rd party libraries (if any)  -  I not used any 3rd party tools/libraries
* Detail any assumptions you made or known issues you didn't get time to resolve  -  not finished cell types in detail screen
* Please add any comments or notes that we should consider as part of your application  -  Well you can see min data handling in PolicyEventStream.swift file , also 
please check Car.swift line 18 , here I used some random time to be able to test 
case where there is active policy. Its now 26250000, feel free to "play" with it
